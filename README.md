Project title - Smart CityX
## Description
Smart CityX is a java full stack web application  designed to provide newcomers with clear visibility of tourist attractions and hotels in the city.
This project aims to help users easily discover and explore the best spots in town, making their visit enjoyable and hassle-free.

## Project Overview
This project was developed as part of a 24-hour hackathon, where our team collaborated intensively to bring this idea to life. 
The application features an intuitive interface that allows users to search for and view detailed information about tourist places and hotels in the city.

## My Contribution
As the frontend developer in our project team, I focused on developing the Hotels page. 
This page includes a comprehensive list of hotels, complete with descriptions, ratings, and booking options. 
My goal was to ensure that the page is user-friendly and visually appealing, making it easy for users to find and choose the perfect accommodation for their stay.

## Hackathon Experience
Participating in this 24-hour hackathon was a tremendous experience. 
I learned many new things, from advanced frontend development techniques to effective team collaboration.
This project allowed us to acquire more knowledge and apply it in a real-world scenario, enhancing both our technical skills and our ability to work under pressure.
